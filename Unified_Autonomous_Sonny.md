## Unified Autonomous Sonny: Final Amalgamation & Documentation

This document outlines the unification, stabilization, and explicit architecture of Sonny as a robust, production-ready autonomous agent.

### 1. Unified Frontend (Streamlit)
- All previous UI flows (Silver, Gold, Cinnabar, Combined, Home, Autonomous Testing) are integrated into `UnifiedAgent.py`.
- Intuitive tabbed layout with an **always-accessible 'Talk to Sonny' chat interface** for natural interaction.
- Each path (tab) exposes its automation/AI logic, with real-time updates on Symbolic State.
- Chat uses autonomous backend agent for transparent, stepwise responses.

### 2. Restored UI Components & Websocket Handling
- All pre-existing UI widgets/components preserved and accessible.
- State and results are updated reactively with `st.session_state` and live calls; explicit websocket layering was not present or required for current use cases, but is modular for future real-time push integration.

### 3. Explicit Autonomous Backend Reasoning
- `autonomous_agent.py` updated for transparent, step-by-step logging and symbolic state tracking.
- `AutonomousAgent.reason_decide_act(user_input)` clearly:
    1. Receives and parses input
    2. Decides which tool (CMD, CODEX CLI, SYMBOLIC AI)
    3. Executes the tool
    4. Logs each intermediate reasoning/decision/result
    5. Records all steps in the shared SymbolicState for live introspection
- All chat (and task) logic is routed through this agent for explainable, auditable automation.

### 4. Consistent Unified API Endpoints
- API interfaces between backend_core_service and symbolic_ai_service are standardized:
    - `/process/`: Accepts user input, invokes unified reasoning, and returns explainable log/result.
    - `/state/`: Returns current symbolic state.
    - `/interpret/`, `/respond/`, `/script/`: Proxy directly to symbolic service.
    - All endpoints consistently validated, error-logged, and Pydantic-conforming.

### 5. Explicit End-to-End Test Coverage
- End-to-end and unit tests present under each module's `tests/` dir and in repo root to validate:
    - UI logic and component rendering
    - Backend agent decisions and tool selection
    - Path-to-path and chat dialog integration
- Tests validate correct symbolic state tracking and error handling.
- (Note: CI instructions: test suite should be rerun on each merge; local pytest works with proper venv/paths.)

### 6. Next Steps and Roadmap
- Real-time websocket state/event push can be layered on top of chat or future UI, as state/session tracking is modular.
- For advanced agent autonomy, extend `reason_decide_act` with multi-step planning and streaming responses.

**Sonny is now stabilized as a single cohesive, explicitly-logged, explainable autonomous system.**
