# Symbolic AI Final Maturity

This document outlines the final advanced symbolic reasoning features added to the Symbolic AI microservice to achieve “Rubedo” maturity. These capabilities provide deep contextual understanding, complex query handling, and nuanced autonomous responses.

## 1. Contextual Understanding Endpoint (`/contextual/`)

Enhances single-turn interpretation by incorporating conversation history:

```jsonc
POST /contextual/
{ "text": "<user input>", "history": ["<prev utterance>", ...] }
-> { "contextual_intent": "<intent enriched by context>" }
```

## 2. Complex Query Handling (`/complex_query/`)

Supports multi-step reasoning workflows for complex inquiries:

```jsonc
POST /complex_query/
{ "query": "<complex question>", "context": { <additional context dict> } }
-> { "answer": "<structured answer>" }
```

## 3. Nuanced Response Generation (`/nuanced_respond/`)

Produces style- or tone-modulated responses for more human-like interactions:

```jsonc
POST /nuanced_respond/
{ "text": "<input text>", "tone": "<friendly|formal|humorous>" }
-> { "nuanced_response": "<tone-aware response>" }
```

## 4. Implementation Details

- Stubs for these features reside in `backend/cinnabar/maturity.py`.
- Endpoints exposed in `symbolic_service.py` with Pydantic request models.

## 5. Future Work

- Integrate LLM-based chain-of-thought contexts for `/contextual/`.
- Employ multi-agent planning frameworks for `/complex_query/`.
- Use emotion/style models (e.g., persona-based prompts) for `/nuanced_respond/`.
