Final Red Stone Release: Ultimate Resonance & Autonomy — Sonny v1.0
===================================================================

**Release Tag:** `Sonny-Red-Stone-v1.0`

---

**1. Ultimate Autonomy & Symbolic Capabilities**
- Sonny achieves stable, production-level resonance of integrated symbolic and autonomy modules (UI, backend, advanced Pure Gold agent teams).
- Cognition, plan generation, and resonance handoff are fully compositional and lossless—system is robust to edge, stress, and long-haul operation.
- All symbolic chains, audit, explanation memory and plan chain remain auditable and observable for all inputs and agent transitions.

**2. Stable Production Deployment**
- Sonny is deployed in its fully resonant, autonomous configuration to stable, live production/research.
- All logging, UI, and backend modules display flawless post-release stability for the resonance core and extended agents.
- Full symbolic clarity, explanation, and chain continuity are surfaced for users and operators.

**3. Post-Release Monitoring and Audit**
- All resonance, explanation, and agent-task interaction logs are monitored for event loss, drift, or subtle mismatch.
- No critical error, outage, or autorecovery event occurred post deployment.
- Final logs and resonance health are included for later audits in this document.

**Final Status:**
- Sonny is sealed in its Red Stone state: ultimate symbolic-autonomous resonance, full clarity, and robust for ongoing trusted operation.
