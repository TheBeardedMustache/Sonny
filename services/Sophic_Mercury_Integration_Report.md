Sophic Mercury Integration Report: Advanced Symbolic Modules in Sonny
====================================================================

**Integrated Modules:**
- Core Base: `Sonny.py`, `autonomous_agent.py`, `symbolic_service.py`
- New: `advanced_ai_agents`, `multimodal_coding_agent_team`, `ai_Self-Evolving_agent`

---

### 1. Explicit Integration Into Sonnyâ€™s Core
- Each new module is incorporated as a composable, auditable enhancement to the symbolic reasoning/core autonomy loop.
    - `advanced_ai_agents` (deep plan/explanation augmentation, advanced agent interaction)
    - `multimodal_coding_agent_team` (symbolic reasoning applied to complex, team-based/AI-multimodal coding scenarios)
    - `ai_Self-Evolving_agent` (self-improving symbolic feedback loops, meta-reasoning, and self-diagnostic logic)
- Explicit entry points and agent protocols are implemented, respecting the stability and log structure of the core symbolic/autonomy framework.

### 2. Seamless Interaction & Amalgamation Verification
- All agent modules log interactions, plans, and explanations through established symbolic reasoning and autonomy logs (including `sophic_mercury_integration.log`, `autonomy_enhancements.log`).
- Symbolic event chains triggered by advanced or multimodal agents are surfaced in the real-time UI and durable logs for audit.
- Integration tests confirm:
    - No regression in symbolic plan generation, tool decisions, or auditability.
    - All modules interact and escalate symbolic state as expected.
    - Self-evolving agent module produces self-diagnostic, meta-plan logs visible to both UI and backend.
    - System performance and UI liveness confirmed under mixed/advanced symbolic-agent load.

### 3. Documentation and Guarantees
- All module boundaries, logs, and agent interactions are documented here for developer and research reference.
- The framework is now explicitly suited for further team-based, multimodal, and meta/feedback-driven reasoning.
- The symbolic reasoning amalgamation is thoroughly cross-referenced with logs and UI panels.
- No critical errors or regressions experienced in stability, logic, or audit capabilities.
