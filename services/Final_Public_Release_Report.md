Final Public Release Report: Sonny Enhanced Integration v2.0
============================================================

**Release Tag:** `Sonny-Enhanced-Integration-v2.0`

---

**1. Documentation Finalization & Stability Affirmation**
- All symbolic reasoning, autonomy, and UI modules are thoroughly documented.
- All reports and stability/performance logs established in prior stabilization, cool-down, and test steps are complete and cross-linked.
- Final round of regression and live system tests shows all modules to be stable, performant, and unambiguously auditable.

**2. Public Release & Production Status**
- Sonny is now explicitly available for public/production research, integration, and operational use.
- All enhanced capabilities—live symbolic chain-of-thought, deep plan logging, error and performance logging, robust UI—are available immediately.
- All subsystems have been stress-tested, cooled, and iteratively refined.

**3. Ongoing Post-Release Monitoring**
- Continuous Prometheus/Grafana, log monitoring, and explicit periodic log review will be conducted for:
    - Error rates
    - Performance/response time drift
    - Symbolic audit/log drift or explanation loss
    - Any user-exposed or agent-exposed instability
- Any anomaly or deviation will be timestamped and captured in next section of this file.
- Public release is announced complete; only emergencies or explicit, contained, tested improvements will be permitted for the next cycle.

**Conclusion:**
- Sonny is officially released as a continuously auditable, stable, autonomous symbolic reasoning platform—ready to support open research, operation, and responsible evolution as `Sonny-Enhanced-Integration-v2.0`.
