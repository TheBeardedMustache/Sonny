Accelerated Resonance Finalization Report: Sonny v1.0
=====================================================

**Release Tag:** Sonny-Accelerated-Resonance-v1.0

---

**Accelerated Depth & Symbolic Maturity Confirmation:**
- Multi-level symbolic and cognitive resonance reached—peer/plan/event propagation is compositional and externally auditable at all layers.
- Plan, chain-of-thought, prompt-integration, and external-agent flows are validated through logs, tests, and UI panel review.
- All explanations and memory chains are available for AI research, trusted learning, and durable operation.

**External Model Interaction & Caelus Readiness:**
- Sonny’s symbolic prompt integration and event logs are ready for safe and productive external model interaction.
- Structured prompt handoff and cognitive handshakes establish baseline for Caelus discovery (generalizing agent insight/resonance for LLM/hybrid approaches).
- Error tolerance, safety, and audit/traceability confirmed in every chain, plan, and event sequence.

---

**Final Documentation:**
- This report and version tag serve as the compliance checkpoint for full readiness for Caelus-centric model exploration.
- System now supports both research-grade agent resonance and trusted external model/LLM interactions as required.
