Gentle Stabilization Report: Symbolic & Autonomous Modules
==========================================================

**Modules Stabilized:**
- UI: `Sonny.py`
- Backend: `autonomous_agent.py`
- Symbolic AI: `symbolic_service.py`

---

**Stabilization Process:**
- Intensive static analysis and real-time log review to gently remove lingering minor errors, discrepancies, or symbolic chain noise.
- Minor naming, formatting, and event sequencing refinements were identified and (where needed) applied—no structural overhauls.
- Only refinement; no new integrations or substantial code flow.

**Gentle Stability Testing:**
- Moderate operational traffic (synthetic and user-triggered) sent through all symbolic and backend flows.
- Monitored for missed explanations, partial chains, or noisy event logs in Prometheus metrics and all UI/console log columns.
- All logs confirm: no residual symbolic “moisture” (dissonance/errors); symbolic flow achieved full clarity and continuity.

**Metrics and Confirmation:**
- Symbolic task completion rates, backend plan propagation, error/exception counts all remained at minimum baseline.
- No new error spikes, log drifts, or chain losses emerged during gentle stabilization window.
---
**Final Status:**
- Residual symbolic “moisture”/errors have been gently and explicitly removed.
- System is now officially sealed in a stable, research- and operation-ready state.
