Royal Diadem Integration: Explicit Amalgamation of All Agent Frontends in Sonny.py
======================================================

**Summary:**
This document describes the *explicit integration* of the following frontend service components into `frontend/Sonny.py` (the Royal Diadem):

- Silver Path (Desktop Automation)
- Gold Path (Autonomous Coding)
- Cinnabar Path (Natural Language Understanding)
- Combined Path (Full Workflow)
- Unified Chat Interface

Each of these logical service frontends is now explicitly defined in a unified Streamlit `tabs`-based app:

**Technical Changes:**

1. All relevant code/UI from `components/silver.py`, `gold.py`, `cinnabar.py`, `combined.py` is inlined directly into `Sonny.py` tab sections. No dynamic importing of UI modules remains.
2. A fully unified chat is implemented in the first tab, using `st.chat_input` and `st.chat_message`, tracking full conversational history in `st.session_state["messages"]`.
3. **Each individual path tab** (Silver, Gold, Cinnabar, Combined):
   - Shows its own header and explicit UI widgets.
   - All user actions and results are logged to `logs/chat_interactions.log` using the `log_frontend` function (with path-specific tags).
   - Real-time symbolic state is shown for transparency.
4. **Real-time logging:**
   - Every interface (including chat and each automation path) logs all actions to `logs/chat_interactions.log`.
   - Side-by-side log columns: Frontend (chat), Backend, Symbolic AI logs visible in the chat tab.
5. The module is independently executable and does not rely on external UI modules for its core logic.

**Interface Consistency:**
- All previous UI capabilities from Silver, Gold, Cinnabar, Combined, and unified chat are now presented in a single, production-ready Streamlit interface.
- Users can easily navigate between paradigms.
- Logging is explicit and comprehensive for all interactions.

**Testing/Validation:**
- Manual and automated tests should ensure:
    - All tabs work independently and together.
    - All logs are written as expected.
    - Symbolic state is correctly visualized per path.

This unifies the **Royal Diadem** as the single entrypoint and control surface for Sonny's multi-paradigm automation, coding, and chat reasoning.
