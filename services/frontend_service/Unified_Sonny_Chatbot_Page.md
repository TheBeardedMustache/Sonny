## Unified Sonny Chatbot Page

### Overview
This enhancement merges and replaces the previous separate UI entrypoints (`app.py`, `Home_Page.py`, `UnifiedAgent.py`) with a **single cohesive Streamlit application**:  
`frontend_service/frontend/Sonny.py`

### Features
- **Unified chat interface:** Uses Streamlit's built-in `st.chat_input` and `st.chat_message` for a seamless modern chat UX.
- **Backend integration:** Sends each user message to backend's `process_chat()` and displays the assistant's reply.
- **Real-time logging panel:** Displays (in parallel columns) the last ~40 lines of each:
    - Frontend chat log (`chat_interactions.log`)
    - Backend autonomy log (`autonomy_log.log`)
    - Symbolic AI log (`symbolic_reasoning.log`)
- **All frontend interactions are logged** in structured format to `frontend_service/logs/chat_interactions.log`.

### Usage
- Run:  
  ```sh
  streamlit run Sonny.py
  ```
- Enter messages at the bottom; responses display inline in the chat and all panels update in real time.
- All actions are timestamped, context-tagged, and auditable in the log files.

### Files Removed/Obsoleted
- `app.py`, `Home_Page.py`, `UnifiedAgent.py` â€“ now replaced by `Sonny.py`.

### Example Log (Chat)
```

[2024-06-22 21:55:12] [FRONTEND|SONNY] Hello human.
```

**Summary:**  
This is now the official, minimal, and modern entrypoint for Sonny. All chat, backend, and symbolic logs are visible in real time for full transparency and diagnostics.
