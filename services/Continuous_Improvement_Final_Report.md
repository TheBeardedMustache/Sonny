---

**Explicit Automation of Incremental Enhancement:**
- Automation frameworks established for continuous symbolic/cognitive improvement, guided by live metrics and test results from Prometheus/Grafana.
- All enhancements require modular, testable, and incremental design, with version locking and rollback assurance for every cycle.
- Integrations, symbolic modules, and plan flows are compositional, with detailed logs, audit records, and snapshot-based deployment.

**Modular Deployment for Ongoing Enhancement:**
- Modularization of UI, backend, symbolic agents, and prompt/context features supports safe, incremental hot-swap or staging upgrades.
- Each package/release is versioned, independently testable, and safely rolled out or rolled back.
- All upgrades and incremental deployments are logged and documented against baseline and target state.

**Finalization and Documentation:**
- This report and module log files serve as operational and research anchor for continuous improvement and secure deployment.
- Sonny is now released in “Philosopher’s Stone” state — maximally clear, stable, and ready for perpetual, explicit, trusted improvement.
