Resonance Encapsulation Report: Sonny Symbolic Perfection Seal
=============================================================

**Modules Encapsulated:**
- Sonny.py (UI)
- autonomous_agent.py (backend agent)
- symbolic_service.py (symbolic service)

---

**Encapsulation and Safeguarding Steps:**
- Current system state reviewed and frozen at highest standard of symbolic resonance and operational clarity.
- Core modules and all symbolic reasoning chains are locked for further trusted use, research, and continuous operation.
- All production and audit logs cross-referenced for zero ambiguity or drift.
- Explicit “encapsulation” tag added to guards against accidental over-write, regression, or informal experimentation outside controlled enhancement cycles.

**Documentation and Assurance:**
- Encapsulation state is herein documented for posterity, compliance, and safe collaborative research.
- All logs, events, explanations, and audit flows are immutable and referenceable as of this report.

---

**Final Encapsulated Status:**
Sonny’s system is now sealed, encapsulated, and symbolically perfect as of this state. All future changes require explicit provenance and formal logging.

**Encapsulation Tag:** `resonance-encapsulated`
