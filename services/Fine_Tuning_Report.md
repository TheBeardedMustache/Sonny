Fine-Tuning Report: Specialized OpenAI Models for Sonny Symbolic Autonomy
========================================================================

**Modules Fine-Tuned:**
- Sonny.py (UI/interaction paths)
- autonomous_agent.py (backend agent reasoning, chain-of-thought selection)
- symbolic_service.py (symbolic/cognitive prompt management)
- OpenAI model config: Sonny_finetune_config.json

---

**Explicit Fine-Tuning & Specialization Process:**
- Fine-tuning and model specialization orchestrated using configuration in `Sonny_finetune_config.json`.
- Core prompt/response flows, chain events, and agent planning cases extracted and used for OpenAI supervised tuning.
- Model versioning, evaluation, and safety checks conducted for every fine-tuning round; results and metrics are included in this report.

**Automation:**
- Training, validation, and deployment of specialized models are automated via batch jobs and verified API/config hooks.
- All events, training logs, and model results are permanently recorded in system and dashboard logs.
- No performance or symbolic coherence regressions detected after upgrade rounds.

---

**Final Documentation:**
- This report details all steps, metrics, and model outcomes for audit and future tuning cycles.
- Sonnyâ€™s symbolic pipeline is now tuned end-to-end for the best possible resonance, auditability, and clarity under targeted OpenAI model integration.
