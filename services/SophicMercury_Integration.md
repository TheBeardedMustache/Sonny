Sophic Mercury: Explicit Integration of Advanced Symbolic Reasoning
===================================================================

**Summary**: This document outlines explicit integration of advanced ("Sophic Mercury") symbolic reasoning into Sonnyâ€™s symbolic AI, backend, and Streamlit UI.

1. **Symbolic AI Service (nlu.py, response.py, advanced.py):**
   - Analyze and plan via chain-of-thought and symbolic philosophical routines (see `analyze_text`, `plan_tasks`).
   - Log all insight, plans, and responses to `logs/sophic_mercury_integration.log`.
   - Pass structured context and outcomes to the backend.

2. **Backend Core Service (autonomous_agent.py):**
   - Integrates all Sophic Mercury symbolic fields for deep context/contextual decision-making.
   - Decision prompts for tool selection (CMD, Codex) now explicitly use Sophic outputs, chain-of-thought, and plans.
   - Logs all Sophic analysis and decisions to `logs/autonomy_enhancements.log`.

3. **Frontend Service (Sonny.py):**
   - Presents live stream of all Sophic Mercury symbolic logs, next to backend, symbolic, error, and chat logs in the chat interface.
   - All UI log accesses and readouts are in `logs/real_time_logs.log` for audit.

**Operational Guarantee**: All steps and deep reasoning logs are real-time, explicit, and preserved for audit/machine learning. Extend as a blueprint for advanced symbolic reflection across the stack.
