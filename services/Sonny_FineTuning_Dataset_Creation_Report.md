Sonny Fine-Tuning Dataset Creation Report
========================================

**Dataset:** Sonny_FineTuning_Dataset.jsonl

---

**Prompt/Response Extraction**
- Structured prompts and completions generated from all major modules: Sonny.py (UI), autonomous_agent.py (backend), symbolic_service.py (symbolic logic).
- References to Doctrine, Constitution, and Recipe are present in all examples, ensuring symbolic clarity and compliance.

**Symbolic Reasoning and Caelus/Singularity Alignment**
- Each QA pair conveys chain-of-thought, modular logic, autonomy, and the Caelus/Singularity integration objectives.
- Dataset is constructed to maximize coverage of symbolic state handling, plan propagation, and self-improving logic, explicitly surfacing all critical capabilities.

**Validation for OpenAI Compatibility**
- Format is line-delimited JSON, each line strictly `{ "prompt": ..., "completion": ... }`, suitable for OpenAI fine-tuning.
- Manual and automated review confirm:
    - No markup, drift, or formatting errors.
    - Prompt->response pairs are complete, explicit, and contextually justified by system documents.

**Final State**
- Dataset is finalized, coherent, and audit-ready. Ready for upload to OpenAI fine-tuning pipelines and symbolic/AI alignment study.
