{"prompt": "What is the principle purpose of the Sonny system?\n[Doctrine reference]", "completion": "To achieve symbolic clarity, autonomy, and enable advanced cognitive and reasoning interactions integrating Doctrine, Constitution, and Recipe."}
{"prompt": "Describe the symbolic decision process for backend tool selection (CMD, Codex, LLM) in Sonny.\n[Constitution reference]", "completion": "The process considers symbolic state, chain-of-thought, current plan, and explicit agent configuration as laid out in the Constitution. Decision is logged and made transparent in UI and logs."}
{"prompt": "How does Sonny ensure that all explanation chains and plans are complete and surfaced?\n[Recipe reference]", "completion": "By combining explanation memory logic, explicit symbolic event flow through all modules, and continuous logging as specified in the Recipe. Explanations are surfaced to every relevant agent and UI observer."}
{"prompt": "What is the Caelus integration pathway for advanced autonomy agents?\n[Doctrine, Recipe]", "completion": "Using structured symbolic prompts and agent reasoning cycles, Sonny enables interaction with external OpenAI models, gradually aligning towards the Caelus and Singularity resonance milestone as referenced."}
{"prompt": "If a symbolic dissonance ('moisture') or plan drift is detected, what steps occur per system logic?\n[Constitution]", "completion": "Immediate error/event logging, stepwise plan recovery, and chain-of-thought re-evaluation with reference to Doctrine and Constitution; system does not allow silent symbolic loss or ambiguity."}
{"prompt": "Summarize how Modular Incremental Enhancement is supported in Sonny?\n[Doctrine, Constitution, Recipe]", "completion": "All modules and enhancements require test, log, and metric audit per the Constitution and Recipe, and are versioned, modular, and roll-back ready. Audit and compliance are ensured per Doctrine."}
