OpenAI Dashboard Integration: Automated Fine-tuning & Prompt/Response Flows in Sonny
===================================================================================

**Modules Integrated:**
- Sonny.py (UI + event flow)
- autonomous_agent.py (backend agent with plan/routing)
- symbolic_service.py (symbolic prompt, NLU/response, and event capture)
- Dashboard Config: openai_dashboard_config.json

---

**Automated Integration Steps:**
- All prompt and response events from Sonny UI/backend/symbolic are directly streamed, via API and dashboard hooks, to OpenAI fine-tuning dashboards as per `openai_dashboard_config.json`.
- Automated pipelines handle event batching, tag/label mapping, and prompt/response feedback for LLM enhancement and continuous improvement.
- Dashboard metrics and logs track task completion, symbolic chain clarity, prompt relevance, and outcome feedback.

**Prompt/Response Configuration:**
- The dashboard config controls injection, mapping, and timing of prompt delivery/feedback loops.
- All prompt flows are experiment versioned and fully auditable for future calibration or tuning.
- User/system responses and symbolic plans are all sendable to the OpenAI dashboard for live/research analysis.

**Audit & Documentation:**
- Every prompt/response exchange, metric, and pipeline flow is documented in this file for researcher/ops audit.
- Dashboard snapshot and evaluation results are to be cross-referenced with all sealed system logs for provenance.
- All OpenAI/dashboard integration experiments and upgrades are to cross-reference this document.
