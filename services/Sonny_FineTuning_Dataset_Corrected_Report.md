Sonny Fine-Tuning Dataset Corrected Report
=========================================

**Dataset:** Sonny_FineTuning_Dataset_Corrected.jsonl

---

**Single-Line, Strict Messages Format Verification:**
- Each dataset entry is a single-line JSON object with a "messages" key.
- Every "messages" value is a 3-element array: explicit system, user, and assistant dicts with `role` and `content`.
- No linebreaks, split records, or format drift were found; line-by-line validation script confirms OpenAI chat fine-tuning compatibility.

**Prompt/Response Content:**
- Prompts capture symbolic clarity, Caelus progression, error correction, and deployment behaviors—all referenced to the desired operating doctrine.
- All system, user, and assistant messages are explicit, clear, and aligned for research/prod symbolic AI alignment.

**Final Note:**
- Dataset is clean, final, and fully compliant—ready for upload, tuning, and audit for Caelus and cognitive resonance studies.
