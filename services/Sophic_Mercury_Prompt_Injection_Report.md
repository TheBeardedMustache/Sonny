Sophic Mercury Prompt Injection Report: Symbolic Resonance and Model Interaction
================================================================================

**Modules Enhanced with Prompt Injections:**
- Sonny.py (UI, agent entry)
- autonomous_agent.py (backend planner)
- symbolic_service.py (symbolic AI)
- Source: `structured_prompt_injections.json`

---

**Injection Protocol:**
- Small, auditably-logged portions of prompts from `structured_prompt_injections.json` are gradually, clearly injected into each module's model and planning interface logic.
- Each prompt is cross-checked for context fit, auditability, and explicit symbolic resonance.
- Integration is monitored and logged in `prompt_injection_logs.log` for audit and traceability.

**Monitoring & Outcome:**
- All prompt injections are timestamped, contextually verified, and scored for impact on planning, learning, and symbolic explanation completeness.
- No drift, model confusion, or symbolic/logic regression was detected under incremental integration.
- Symbolic and UI/plan logs show improved cohesion and chain propagation toward external model endpoints.

**Documentation and Guarantee:**
- Every prompt and model context change is logged and documented here and in the injection logs for downstream audit.
- The symbolic core remains clear, extendable, and fully audit-ready after injection (no hidden drift or dissonance).
- External model integration is now pre-blessed for gentle extension via further structured prompt context.
- This document is a permanent summary and guide for all prompt-based symbolic/model interventions.
