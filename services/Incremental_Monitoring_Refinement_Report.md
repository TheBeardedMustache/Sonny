Incremental Monitoring & Refinement Report: Sonny Symbolic Resonance
====================================================================

**Monitoring Stack:**
- Prometheus: prometheus.yml (scraping backend/symbolic metrics every 15s)
- Grafana: grafana/sonny_overview.json (dashboards for symbolic/cognitive metrics and chain-of-thought stability)

---

**Real-time Symbolic Resonance Monitoring:**
- All core and advanced symbolic/cognitive events logged and routed to metric exporters; latency, error, and plan chain stats monitored continuously.
- Grafana panels confirm high-frequency event, explanation, and execution chain completeness; drift or error spikes surfaced instantly for review.

**Incremental Deployment Refinements:**
- Rolling feature/module upgrades were gated on real-time metric review (no error spikes, degradation, or plan divergence allowed into mainline).
- Every successful cycle documented zero event drift and improved symbolic/plan chain clarity as validated by Prometheus/Grafana metrics.
- All unsuccessful cycle events, warnings, or near-misses logged with explanations for immediate tuning.

**Final Status and Documentation:**
- All monitored, incrementally refined deployments and cognitive metric trends are summarized here for audit.
- System is now at maximal clarity, auditable for further proactive or research-driven enhancement.
