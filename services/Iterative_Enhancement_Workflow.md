Iterative Enhancement Workflow for Sonny (Symbolic Core)
=======================================================

**Purpose:**
Ensure safe, explicit, controlled evolution of symbolic reasoning/autonomy logic and infrastructure.

---

**Guiding Principles:**
- All enhancements must be **incremental, transparent, and explicitly logged**.
- Permanent symbolic/autonomy logic is the baseline; only well-tested improvements are merged.
- All logs and integration points (including error/cooldown/report logs) are continuous audit sources.

---

**1. Enhancement Proposal & Planning**
- Each enhancement (whether symbolic logic, UI/UX, metrics, or backend) begins with an *explicit proposal document* with rationale, backwards-compatibility notes, and logging plan.
- All proposals are tagged with baseline version, new docs/metrics to be created, and strict rollback steps.

**2. Controlled Development & Replication**
- Work is done in short, tightly-scoped branches, tested in isolation, and only merged post-review and explicit log/metrics audit.
- Replication (for symbolic regression tests etc.) must be automated; every new symbolic reasoning feature or complexity ramp includes:
    - Tests for old/new path preservation
    - Synthetic log/event replication for clear metric comparison
- **No enhancement is merged that cannot be fully replicated or explained.**

**3. Continuous Integration & Automated Testing**
- All code and symbolic plans must pass existing pytest/unit/integration framework **before** merge.
- CI runs must demonstrate:
    - 0 error log increases
    - No symbolic performance regression
    - New plan/explanations in logs as required before/after change
- Rollbacks tested for every enhancement cycle to guarantee revertibility.

**4. Deployment & Audit**
- After merge, logs, UI panels, Prometheus metrics, and error/cooldown reports must all show preservation (or improvement!) of symbolic transparency.
- Weekly audit: all enhancement merges and metrics, reviewed with defined summary in incremental-progress log.

---

**Docs & Traceability:**
- All enhancements, backtests, logs, and CI outcomes are referenced in this doc and cross-referenced in release/fixation/stability docs.
- The platform now ensures both controlled progress *and* full reproducibility for all symbolic and autonomy changes.

**This workflow guarantees Sonny's symbolic intelligence can grow, but only incrementally and auditably.**
