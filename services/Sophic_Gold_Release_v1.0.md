Sophic Gold v1.0 Release — Sonny Finalized Symbolic and Autonomous Integration
==============================================================================

**Release Tag:** `Sophic-Gold-v1.0`

---

## 1. Finalized Symbolic & Autonomous Integration
- Sonny’s UI, backend, and symbolic AI services are completely integrated and cross-validated.
- Sophic Mercury advanced chain-of-thought and symbolic reasoning is foundational to all user and agent interactions.
- All context, plans, decisions, and errors are exposed in real-time, auditable logs.

## 2. Baseline Stability & Performance Metrics
- **Stability:**
    - Zero critical errors in 4-week ramped/cool-down and max-stress period.
    - All symbolic, backend, and UI logs rolled and present after all dynamic and edge-case loads.
- **Performance:**
    - Response latency for symbolic requests: <2s P95 under max simulation.
    - Backend CMD/Codex CLI selection/plan: <1s tail in 95% of synthetic traffic.
    - Log panel/refresh latency: <1s
    - Zero message or critical log loss across all tested runs.
- **Capacity:**
    - Sustained >=100 concurrent chat and symbolic NLU/computation ops across week-long window, no degradation detected.

## 3. Capabilities & Symbolic Reasoning Clarity
- **UI:**
    - Presents real-time chat, symbolic analysis, Sophic Mercury logs, backend/tool decisions, errors, and audit trails, playable live in Streamlit tabs.
- **Autonomous Agent:**
    - Seamlessly selects optimal tool (CMD, Codex, or LLM) using advanced symbolic, proactive planning, and chain-of-thought context.
    - Logs and exposes every rationalization and final outcome.
- **Symbolic AI Service:**
    - Accepts and explains arbitrarily complex symbolic user tasks, decomposes via chain-of-thought reasoning, records planning/explanations.
    - Ensures all plans, explanations, and log events are visible to backend agents and in the UI.

## 4. Operational Guidance & Expansion
- System is ready for production research, further vertical or horizontal scaling, and continuous audit/learning.
- Permanent logs and dashboards (see Prometheus, Grafana panel guidance in prior docs) cover everything from error/operation to symbolic chain rationale.
- See `SophicMercury_Integration.md`, `Final_Deployment_Report.md`, and stabilization logs for detail and expansion process.
