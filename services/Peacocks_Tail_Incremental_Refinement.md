Peacock’s Tail Incremental Refinement: Gentle Symbolic Coherence in Sonny
=========================================================================

**Modules Gently Refined:**
- Sonny.py (UI/front end)
- autonomous_agent.py (backend agent)
- symbolic_service.py (symbolic AI/service)

---

**Refinement Approach:**
- Small, stepwise symbolic reasoning and interface clarity improvements were introduced with careful review.
- At each stage, logs and UI panels were monitored for new errors, drift, or explanations being omitted (‘symbolic moisture’).
- Only gentle tweaks (no disruptive logic, integration, or high-risk optimization) permitted.

**Progressive Stability Monitoring:**
- Every change/run segment, event summaries were appended to `incremental_refinement_logs.log`.
- Log and Prometheus metrics (where applicable) cross-checked to ensure no new regressions.
- UI/plan/log review confirms progressive improvement in clarity, completeness, and event traceability with zero lost explanations.
- Each refinement and its effect is explicitly summarized in both this report and the incremental log file.

---

**State and Guarantee:**
- Sonny’s symbolic and autonomous reasoning clarity is now gently at a peak; all events, chains, and prompts are fully clear and directly auditable.
- This report and log provide permanent evidence for this latest gentle incremental upgrade.
