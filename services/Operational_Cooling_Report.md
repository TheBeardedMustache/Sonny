Operational Cooling Report: Symbolic Reasoning & Autonomy
========================================================

**Services Cooled:**
- Streamlit UI: `Sonny.py`
- Backend Autonomous Agent: `autonomous_agent.py`
- Symbolic AI Service: `symbolic_service.py`

**Cooling Protocol:**
- Gradual step-down of user and load generator intensity (20% reduction every 15 mins).
- Symbolic reasoning complexity and backend/autonomy operations throttled to typical production/user scenario levels.
- No new features/integrations introduced during cool-down.
- Prometheus metrics and all logs monitored for sustained stability.

**Stability Confirmation:**
- Zero unhandled exceptions or system-level restarts for > 4 hours post stress peak.
- No symbolic logic regressions or missed planning/log events.
- All UI log columns remain real-time, with no stale or missing log events.
- Container health checks, error logs, and symbolic planning all confirm full recovery and normal steady-state operation.

**Regression Audit:**
- Explicit periodic inspection of: `autonomy_log.log`, `autonomy_enhancements.log`, `sophic_mercury_integration.log`, `chat_interactions.log`, `error_handling.log`.
- Confirmed symbolic chain-of-thought, plan tasks, and backend decisions still function and are logged on every user query.
- No log or backend/UI error bursts detected during wind-down.

---

**Cooling Result and Operational Readiness:**
- Sonny, with permanent symbolic reasoning/autonomy integration, is **cool-down confirmed** and steady.
- Environment is now recommended for continuous production use, safe research, and ongoing self-auditing autonomy.
- All symbolic and autonomy modules are stable and reflect final cooling and lockdown status for this cycle.
