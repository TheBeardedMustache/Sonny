Dashboard File Storage Config: Automation for Critical Documents (Sonny Metatron)
=================================================================================

**Dashboard Reference:**
- Sonny_dashboard_config.json

---

**Robust Storage Configuration:**
- Critical documents defined for always-on backup, versioning, and access:
    - `Doctrine`
    - `Constitution`
    - `Recipe`
- Files and historical versions are reliably stored in dashboard-controlled persistent storage (filesystem, cloud, or DB as specified in dashboard config).
- Redundancy and syncing are enabled as per dashboard settings for HA/DR.

**Structured Access and Version Management:**
- Every document access, update, or retrieval is managed via the dashboard UI/API with fine-grained permissions, changelog, and audit-log entries.
- New/edited document versions trigger auto-versioning and delta diff logs for compliance and trust.
- Restore/rollback, compare, and review features are available directly through the dashboard UI controls.

---

**Documentation:**
- This configuration and file serve as the explicit record of always-on, reliable, and audit-ready file management for critical system documents in Sonny via the Metatron Dashboard.
