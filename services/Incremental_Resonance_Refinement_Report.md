Incremental Resonance Refinement Report: Automated Monitoring and Improvement (Sonny)
====================================================================================

**Monitoring Stack:**
- Prometheus: prometheus.yml (symbolic/autonomous chain metrics)
- Grafana: grafana/sonny_overview.json (event, plan, and symbolic resonance dashboards)

**Modules/Services Involved:**
- Sonny.py (UI)
- autonomous_agent.py (backend agent)
- symbolic_service.py (symbolic cognitive service)

---

**Automated Real-Time Resonance Monitoring:**
- Instrumented and automated roundtrip monitoring of event, plan, and chain-of-thought latency, completion, and clarity.
- All symbolic and agent events surfaced in Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards, with real-time threshold triggers for drift or anomaly.

**Incremental Autonomous Refinement:**
- Periodic automated review scripts check for any resonance metric drift; if found, triggers incremental, explicit plan/log/agent refinement step.
- Each refinement is logged and confirmed with after-action resonance metric auditâ€”no silent drift or unaddressed drops.
- Progression and impact of each refinement is captured in Prometheus logs and Grafana incremental dashboards.

---

**Final Documentation:**
- This file serves as audit record and operational blueprint for trusted, ongoing, metric-driven symbolic and cognitive refinement in Sonny.
