Final Sealed Integration Report: Sonny Symbolic-Prompt Integration v3.0
======================================================================

**Release Tag:** Sonny-Sealed-Integration-v3.0

---

**Comprehensive Integration Confirmation:**
- Sonnyâ€™s core (`Sonny.py`, `autonomous_agent.py`, `symbolic_service.py`) is now fully and seamlessly integrated at UI, backend, and symbolic reasoning layers.
- All audit logs, agent prompts, and chain-of-thought events now roundtrip end-to-end and are surfaced in the UI and backend logs, with no loss or ambiguity.
- All prompt logs, model handoffs, and explanatory states have been sealed for external model interactions (API/model safety and compliance).

**Symbolic-Prompt Stability and Coherence:**
- Structured prompt injections and symbolic chains are coherently passed across user, backend, and symbolic agents, and always explained in logs and UI panels.
- System passes all shutdown-and-restart, edge-case, and stress integration tests for external prompt/model integration.
- Symbolic event clarity and audit guarantees are intact; explicit regression and roundtrip reviews show zero plan/explanation loss.

**Final Sealing and Documentation:**
- All operational and symbolic integration flows are locked as of this release.
- Release and seal is documented here for audit, research, and operational reference.

**Sonny is now officially sealed at v3.0 as a stable, transparent, and auditably integrated symbolic-prompt agent ready for trusted external and internal use.**
