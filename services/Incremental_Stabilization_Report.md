Incremental Stabilization Report: 4-Week Plan for Sonny
=======================================================

**Objective:**
Safely and transparently stabilize advanced symbolic reasoning/autonomous integration in Sonny via structured, incremental, explicit monitoring and test ramp-up. Avoid large new integrations.

---

**Incremental Testing Plan (Weekly):**
- **Week 1:**
    - Run unit/integration tests for all basic symbolic and backend core logic.
    - Verify that logs for core chat, symbolic NLU, and backend autonomy populate without errors.
    - Record log stability assessments in `stability_monitoring.log` as a baseline.
- **Week 2:**
    - Gradually increase the complexity of symbolic reasoning queries (longer prompts, richer plans), run through NLU/response.
    - Watch for exceptions in symbolic and backend logs.
    - Trigger synthetic tasks under expected/edge case symbolic planning.
    - Record errors, slowdowns, anomalies to `stability_monitoring.log`.
- **Week 3:**
    - Continue symbolic complexity increase; introduce chained/cross-path (NLUâ†’backend, combined) scenarios.
    - Monitor response times and error incidence via Prometheus `/metrics` (see `prometheus.yml`) for backend and symbolic containers.
    - Maintain no unhandled exceptions or log instabilities for >72h at a time.
- **Week 4:**
    - Full sustained run with production/realistic user and synthetic symbolic traffic.
    - Weekly review of symbolic/chain log files and Prometheus dashboards.
    - Confirm no new error types and confirm long-lasting container health (restarts only on kills, not errors).

**Explicit Stability Monitoring:**
- Use Prometheus (per `prometheus.yml`) to:
    - Scrape backend/symbolic `/metrics` endpoints every 15s.
    - Forward metrics to Grafana for error/log panel visualization.
- All critical backend/symbolic/chat errors, flaps, and recoveries to be summarized in `stability_monitoring.log` with timestamps.
- Each stability incident is followed by explicit log entry:
    > [WEEK_DAY][TIME] [STABILITY] <description of incident or confirmation of stability>

---

**Integration Policy for Increment:**
- Substantial new subsystem integrations are explicitly avoided for the stabilization period.
- Only bug fixes, resilience, and instrumentation improvements (not new features) are authorized for the period.

---

**Success triggers:**
- If all logs show negligible errors for >4 days (no restarts, no backend/symbolic error bursts) and symbolic tasks grow >2x in complexity, target is met.
- Final summary to be appended to this file and `stability_monitoring.log` on completion.
