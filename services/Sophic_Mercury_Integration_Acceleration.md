Sophic Mercury Integration Acceleration: Structured Prompt & Autonomy Modules in Sonny
=====================================================================================

**Modules/Agents Integrated:**
- Sonny.py (UI)
- autonomous_agent.py (backend agent)
- symbolic_service.py (symbolic AI)
- Structured Prompts: `structured_prompt_injections.json`
- Additional agents: ai_Self-Evolving_agent, ai_domain_deep_research_agent, multimodal_coding_agent_team

---

**Explicit Integration & Prompt Injection:**
- Structured prompts from `structured_prompt_injections.json` were injected and chained through symbolic, backend, and cognitive plan agents.
- New autonomy modules were registered for symbolic state and planning handoff, with explicit logging of all prompt uses and interactions.
- Symbolic reasoning, action selection, and plan explanation routines were enhanced for both solo and collaborative agent path support.

**Integration Validation & Testing:**
- Each agent/module underwent structured interaction, planning, and explanation tests.
- UI event logs, backend decision logs, and symbolic plan logs were reviewed for prompt propagation, explanation clarity, and agent interactivity.
- No symbolic drift, prompt loss, or coordination errors were observed during integration and test cycles.

**Documentation:**
- This file stands as the comprehensive guide and permanent record for the accelerated/structured integration of prompts and agent-driven autonomy in Sonny.
