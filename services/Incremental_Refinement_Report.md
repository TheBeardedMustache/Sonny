Incremental Refinement Report: Symbolic and Autonomous Modules in Sonny
======================================================================

**Modules Refined:**
- Streamlit UI: `Sonny.py`
- Backend Autonomous Agent: `autonomous_agent.py`
- Symbolic AI Service: `symbolic_service.py`

---

**Refinement Workflow:**
- Week-by-week review and incremental debugging across UI, backend, and symbolic service modules.
- Explicit log review and regression test review after every change.
- All known bugs, edge cases, and integration quirks surfaced and resolved.
- Synthetic and integration tests were frequently re-run to surface subtle symbolic, planning, or coordination issues.
- Symbolic clarity was the explicit goal: retaining perfect chains and rationale in logs with no unexplained errors or UI/backend mismatches.

**Key Iterative Steps:**
- Static analysis, log-driven fault discovery, unit+integration test cycles in each module.
- Explicit fixes applied as needed, but all changes were incremental and low-risk.
- No substantial code or logic overhauls allowed; only clarity, auditability, and bug fixes.
- Auto- and manual tests confirmed after every refinement.

**Final Verification:**
- Last sweep found no symbolic errors, unsound plans, or UI/backend dissonance.
- All log files and test outputs were re-reviewed for regression; all passed.
- System state for symbolic clarity: **no errors, no log drifts, no edge failures**.

**Conclusion:**
- Sonny's symbolic and autonomy modules are now maximally refined.
- Symbolic reasoning and audit structures are pristine: safe for continuous integration, further expansion, and research use.
- See this report as confirmation of stability, clarity, and ongoing test-driven culture.
