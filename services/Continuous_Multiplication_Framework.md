Continuous Multiplication Framework for Sonny (Symbolic Core)
============================================================

**Objective:**
- Establish a reproducible, modular, and explicitly auditable framework to support ongoing expansion of symbolic reasoning, autonomy, UI visibility, and process complexity.

---

**1. Modular Expansion & Enhancement Process**
- All symbolic and autonomy modules are encapsulated such that:
    - New chain-of-thought steps, symbolic analyses, planning logics, or backend integrations can be added as composable functions or hooks.
    - Every enhancement or optimization must log operational context and results to a dedicated enhancement log file.

**2. Replication and Testing**
- Unit, integration, and symbolic regression tests run automatically after every module expansion or pipeline improvement.
- Framework includes synthetic scenario generation scripts and replayable test logs to support automatic replication.
- Any new feature or symbolic path must prove through logs (and, as needed, notebook/script replication) that it can be replayed and audited.

**3. Seamless Feature Addition Flow**
- Feature branches include enhancement proposal, synthetic test plan, metrics/log goals, and explicit rollback scripts.
- Merges and deployments only after all log/metrics criteria are achieved.
- Real-time dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana) and log panels in Sonny UI track feature impact in production.

**4. Incremental Monitoring and Documentation**
- Each enhancement step and new symbolic plan or feature complexity is captured in a dedicated framework log and summary doc.
- Weekly incremental progress summaries may be extracted and rolled into milestone reports or UI alerts.

---

**Documentation and Blueprint:**
- This file serves as the reference/blueprint for all future symbolic or autonomy enhancements.
- All logs, configs, test results, and rollback plans must be traceable, reproducible, and available to downstream contributors.
