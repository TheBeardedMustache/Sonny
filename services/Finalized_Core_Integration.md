Finalized Core Integration: Symbolic Reasoning and Autonomous Interactions in Sonny
==================================================================================

## 1. Symbolic Reasoning Logic
- **Sophic Mercury** advanced symbolic reasoning is integrated at every NLU and response generation invocation (symbolic_ai_service).
- Each request is deeply analyzed using chain-of-thought reasoning, planning (plan_tasks), and contextual analysis (analyze_text).
- All symbolic chains, explanations, and plans are passed as explicit context to backend autonomous agent.
- Symbolic logs are directed to both `logs/sophic_mercury_integration.log` and `logs/symbolic_reasoning.log`.

## 2. Autonomous Agent Interaction Logic
- Backend autonomous agent consumes all symbolic outputs, uses context and rationales in planning and tool selection (CMD vs Codex).
- All backend tool decisions and reasoning are echoed to `logs/autonomy_log.log` and `logs/autonomy_enhancements.log` for auditability.
- Any errors and process/event chains are also logged explicitly to `logs/error_handling.log`.

## 3. Real-Time UI Log Integration
- The Streamlit chat UI (`Sonny.py`) displays live logs for each of:
    - Chat
    - Backend autonomy
    - Symbolic AI
    - Sophic Mercury symbolic logs
    - Sophic Mercury backend/autonomy enhancements
    - Error logs
- Every chat and result is logged to `frontend_service/logs/chat_interactions.log`.
- All log read and display accesses are also written to `logs/real_time_logs.log` for full end-to-end observability.

## 4. Integration Completeness Verification
- All advanced symbolic outputs are available live in the chat interface and update on demand.
- All logs are timestamped, real-time, and capture every critical symbolic, backend, autonomy, and error event, ensuring continuous audit and traceability.
- The codebase ensures every key step is both visible and machine-readable for future extension/validation.

## 5. Documentation
- **This file** summarizes the logic, flow, and surface-level guarantees on symbolic/deep autonomy, UI fusion, and logging integration for production-grade, research-ready autonomy in Sonny.
- See also `SophicMercury_Integration.md` for full pipeline blueprint.
