[2025-06-22 19:52:16][GEN_SCRIPT_RESP] Response: "Sure, I can help you generate a Python script to discover Caelus. However, I need more specific details about what you want to discover. Caelus is the Roman god of the sky, and it's also a software for simulating fluid flow (CFD). If you're referring to the software, do you want to install it, run a simulation, or analyze the results? If you're referring to the Roman god, are you looking for information from a database or a web scraping script? Please provide more details so I can assist you better."

[2025-06-22 20:51:49][GEN_SCRIPT_RESP] Response: 'Sure, I can help with that. Here\'s a simple Python script that creates a text file and writes "Hello" to it.\n\n```python\n# Python code to create a text file and write \'Hello\' to it\ndef create_text_file():\n    with open(\'hello.txt\', \'w\') as file:\n        file.write(\'Hello\')\n\n# Call the function\ncreate_text_file()\n```\n\nThis script will create a text file named \'hello.txt\' in the same directory where the script is run. The text file will contain the word \'Hello\'.'
