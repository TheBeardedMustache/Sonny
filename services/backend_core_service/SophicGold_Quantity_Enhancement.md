SophicGold: Quantity/Scale & Robustness Enhancement
==================================================

This file documents explicit scaling and robustness features added to Sonny, including:
- Docker Compose-based service scaling
- Fault-tolerant error handling and recovery patterns
- Explicit resource management docs

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Set via replicas in `docker-compose.yml` for all core services (frontend, backend, symbolic).
- Easy addition of nodes with standard Docker orchestration and built-in log rotation.

**Error Handling and Logging:**
- Every backend core operation is wrapped with try/except and logs all recoverable and fatal errors to `logs/error_handling.log`.
- This enhances post-mortem debugging and incident response.

**Resource Management:**
- Documented best-practices for limiting memory, enforcing restart policies, and log size/rotation.
- Healthchecks and container resource limits recommended.

**See also:** `Scalability_and_Robustness.md` for architecture-level guidance and examples.

---
The result is a Sonny deployment that is scalable, robust to service faults, and production-ready for a wide variety of environments.
