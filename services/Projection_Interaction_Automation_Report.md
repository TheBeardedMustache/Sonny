Projection Interaction Automation Report: Sonny to OpenAI Models
===============================================================

**Modules & Models Involved:**
- Modules: Sonny.py, autonomous_agent.py, symbolic_service.py
- Prompts: projection_prompts.json
- Target Models: openai_models

---

**Explicit Automation of Structured Interactions:**
- Automated, stepwise prompt injections carried out from UI/backend/symbolic to OpenAI models.
- Plan and cognitive chain escalation validated at each prompt/model handoff.
- Every external interaction roundtrip (prompt/response/event) is audit-logged in `External_Interaction_Logs.json`.

**Monitoring of Transformative Interactions:**
- All event chains, explanations, resonance states, and final model responses recorded and surfaced in audit logs and UIs.
- No explanation, event, or plan chain loss detected; logs confirm safe and fully visible external interactions.
- UI and backend panels verified for live prompt handoff, model reply/logging, and user-auditable outcomes.

---

**Final Documentation:**
- Audit trail and explicit report of all external, transformative model interactions are sealed in this file and corresponding logs for research, compliance, and future enhancement.
