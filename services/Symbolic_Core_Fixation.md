Symbolic Core Fixation: Sonny Permanent Symbolic-Autonomy Integration
=====================================================================

**Release Tag:** `symbolic-core-stable`

---

### 1. Permanent Stability of Symbolic Reasoning Modules
- All core symbolic reasoning modules (`backend/cinnabar/nlu.py`, `backend/cinnabar/response.py`, `backend/cinnabar/advanced.py`) are now marked as stable.
- Sophic Mercury chain-of-thought logic, planning, and explanation are locked in and audited.
- Log infrastructure guarantees every symbolic chain, plan, and rationale is end-to-end archived and exposed.

### 2. Permanent Integration into Core Autonomy
- Symbolic reasoning context (analysis, plans, chain-of-thought, explanations) is integrated as a mandatory step into:
    - Autonomous agent planning and tool selection (CMD/Codex)
    - All chat and NLU-driven backend/combined paths
    - UI real-time log and output fusion
- Stability and permanence is verified and locked: all changes prevent accidental regression and will be preserved for downstream extension and research.

### 3. Tagging and Release Confirmation
- Explicitly tagged this pledge as `symbolic-core-stable` for downstream dev audits and research referencing.

### 4. Operational Guarantee and Audit
- All symbolic events, logs, and reasoning are written in durable logs (`chat_interactions.log`, `autonomy_log.log`, `autonomy_enhancements.log`, `sophic_mercury_integration.log`), and surfaced in the chat UI and for audit.
- Core symbolic logic is now foundational, non-optional, and self-monitoring for regression.
- Documentation here is permanent, cross-referenced in all developer and research aids going forward.

**This document and the system logic reflect that Sonnyâ€™s symbolic autonomy is now comprehensive, explicit, and guaranteed stable.**
