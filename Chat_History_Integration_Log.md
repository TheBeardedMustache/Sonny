# Chat History Context-Aware Integration Log

## Chat History Source
- Folder: Nick_and_Caelus_chat_history/
- Main file: conversations.json (parsed for all role/user/assistant turns)

## Changes and Modules
- `services/symbolic_ai_service/backend/core/chat_history_kb.py`: Loads and exposes search/recent APIs
- `services/symbolic_ai_service/backend/cinnabar/base.py`: LLMClient gains with_history_context method, which prepends history as context to LLM calls
- `services/backend_core_service/backend/core/autonomous_agent.py`: All LLM decisions, tool-selection, and fallback answers now use chat context
- `services/symbolic_ai_service/backend/core/autonomous_agent.py`: Convenience chat_with_context method
- `services/symbolic_ai_service/backend/symbolic_service.py`: Exposes POST /history_search endpoint for both query and recent context retrieval

## Context Injection Pattern
- For any text request (decision, code gen, NLU), prepend N hits (default n=3 recent, or search by query) into the `messages` list before main user/system turns
- Context is formatted as `{role, content}` and `content` includes [conversation title]

## Result
- All backend agent LLM behaviors (tool-decision, Cinnabar responses) are now aware of chat context, making responses more resonant and aligned to past discussions
- All endpoints and UIs can access the current chat KB

## Extend
- Add new KB files or extend extraction: update chat_history_kb accordingly
- To switch context from "recent" to "search", pass `history_method="search"` to `with_history_context` or API layer
