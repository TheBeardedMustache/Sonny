# Symbolic AI Advanced Features

This document outlines proposed enhancements to the Symbolic AI microservice for advanced reasoning, planning, and memory capabilities.

## 1. Deep Analysis Endpoint (`/analyze/`)

**Purpose**: Perform chain-of-thought and deep symbolic parsing of user input.

```
POST /analyze/  { "text": "<input text>" }
-> { "analysis": "<detailed analysis>" }
```

## 2. Proactive Planning (`/plan/`)

**Purpose**: Generate multi-step task plans from the current symbolic state.

```
POST /plan/
-> { "tasks": ["task_1", "task_2", ...] }
```

## 3. Memory Retrieval (`/memory/`)

**Purpose**: Retrieve stored memory fragments (e.g., vector embeddings or knowledge snippets).

```
GET /memory/?key=<memory_key>
-> { "key": "<memory_key>", "value": <stored_data> }
```

## 4. Implementation Stubs

Location: `services/symbolic_ai_service/backend/cinnabar/advanced.py`
```python
def analyze_text(text: str) -> dict: ...
def plan_tasks(current_state: dict) -> list: ...
def retrieve_memory(key: str) -> dict: ...
```

## 5. Future Work

- Integrate LLM chain-of-thought patterns for `/analyze/`.
- Use planning frameworks (e.g., Hierarchical Task Networks) for `/plan/`.
- Connect to vector databases or Redis for `/memory/`.
