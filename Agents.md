## Frontend Import Updates

- Verified that import statements in the `frontend` directory already reference modules directly (e.g., `from components.home import home_page`).
- No code changes were required.

## Docker CMD Correction

- Verified Dockerfile `CMD` correctly changes into the `frontend` directory before running Streamlit with `--server.enableCORS=false`.
- No Dockerfile edits needed.
- Reordered Dockerfile build steps: moved `COPY . /app` before dependency installation so that `pip install -e .` finds `setup.py` in the project root.
## Backend Logging and Environment Initialization

- Ensures `.env` is loaded at startup via `load_dotenv()`.
- Configures `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` and a `logger`.
- Moves `OPENAI_API_KEY` validation into an async `startup_event`:
  - Logs an error and raises `ValueError` if the key is missing.
  - Logs an info message when initialized successfully.

## OpenAI SDK v1.0+ Migration

- Migrated from deprecated `openai.ChatCompletion.create` to the new OpenAI Python SDK v1.0+ client API:
  - Uses `from openai import OpenAI` and instantiates `client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))`.
  - Calls `client.chat.completions.create(...)` instead of the deprecated method.
- Confirmed no occurrences of `ChatCompletion.create` remain in the codebase.
  Affected modules: `backend/cinnabar/base.py`, `backend/cinnabar/nlu.py`, `backend/cinnabar/response.py`, `backend/core/codex_auto.py`.
  
## Test Suite Verification

- Scanned all `tests/` modules for deprecated `openai.ChatCompletion.create`; none were found.
- Existing tests utilize the new `OpenAI` client pattern (or monkeypatch the client) and do not require changes.
- Verified that the test suite passes successfully under the updated SDK v1.0+ syntax.

# Frontend-Backend Integration and UX Enhancements

- Wrapped all backend calls in `with st.spinner(...)` to provide dynamic feedback during operations.
- Silver Path: spinners for Move Mouse and Click actions.
- Gold Path: spinner during script generation.
- Cinnabar Path: spinner when interpreting input.
- Combined Path: spinner for proactive task generation.
- Symbolic State display remains updated after operations for transparency.

## API Interaction Optimization

- Direct in-process function calls to the backend eliminate HTTP overhead and reduce latency.
- JSON payloads to the UI are limited to the current symbolic state context for efficient rendering.
## Cleanup and Optimization

- Removed template scaffolding directories (`fresh_regulus_templates/`, `reusable_logic_templates/`).
- Integrated `AgentWrapper` into `backend/core/agent_wrapper.py` for end-to-end task workflows.
- Removed redundant template modules now replaced by production implementations.

# Silver Calx Production-Ready State

- Sonny has been distilled into a lean, modular codebase with no scaffolding templates remaining.
- Real-time symbolic state displayed in the Streamlit UI with dynamic spinners for all operations.
- Backend orchestration via `core_agent.py`, `agent_wrapper.py`, `codex_auto.py`, and `cinnabar` modules.
- Uses OpenAI SDK v1.0+ client with proper `.env` loading, startup validation, and INFO-level logging.
- Dependencies limited to essential libraries; Docker build and CMD optimized for stability and CORS handling.
- Comprehensive pytest suite (unit, integration, UI) passes with zero failures.
 - Sonny is now in **Silver Calx** state: production-ready, maintainable, and performant.

# Agents
Comprehensive overview of Sonny’s agent pathways and capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Mercury Path (Frontend UI)**: Interactive Streamlit-based interface for selecting and configuring agents.
- **Silver Path (Desktop Automation)**: Reliable GUI interactions via PyAutoGUI.
- **Gold Path (Autonomous Coding)**: Dynamic script generation and refinement via OpenAI Codex API and Codex CLI.
- **Cinnabar Path (Natural Language Understanding)**: Advanced LLM-based parsing and response generation.
- **Combined Path (Lunar Venusian Regulus)**: Seamless end-to-end workflows blending UI, GUI automation, code generation, and intelligent understanding.

## Mercury Path: Streamlit Frontend
Sonny provides a refined, responsive UI to:
- Select and configure automation or coding paths.
- Enter parameters (coordinates, prompts, file paths) with validation.
- Display results and logs in real time, with error tracebacks for debugging.
- Purified Silver Interfaces: Frontend code has been streamlined to remove redundancies, simplify components, and optimize responsiveness for an intuitive user experience.

## Silver Path: Desktop Automation
Sonny can automate desktop environments with:
- move_mouse(x, y, duration): Move the cursor.
- click(x, y, button): Mouse clicks.
- drag_mouse(x, y, duration): Cursor dragging.
- type_text(text, interval): Automated typing.
- press_keys(*keys): Keyboard shortcuts.
- open_application(path): Launch applications.
- manage_window(action, window_title): Window management hooks.

## Gold Path: Autonomous Code Generation
Sonny can generate and update code safely:
- generate_script(prompt, model, max_tokens): Create new Python scripts.
- modify_script(file_path, instructions, model, max_tokens): Refine existing scripts.
- run_codex_cli(command, cwd): Execute Codex CLI commands.

## Cinnabar Path: Natural Language Understanding
Sonny can interpret user inputs and produce meaningful responses:
- interpret_input(text, model, max_tokens): Parse and classify commands via OpenAI API.
- generate_response(text, model, max_tokens): Craft assistant responses.

## Combined Path: Lunar Venusian Regulus
By combining all paths, Sonny supports advanced scenarios such as:
- Generating a testing script from a natural language request and deploying it via desktop automation.
- Updating its own code based on conversational feedback and launching auxiliary tools automatically.

All operations include robust error handling, logging, and environment isolation to ensure safety and maintainability.

## Deployment with Docker
Sonny can be containerized for secure and consistent deployment:
- **Dockerfile** defines a Python 3.11 slim environment.
- **Dependencies** are installed from `requirements.txt`.
- **Ports**: Streamlit UI is exposed on port `8501`.
- **Environment**: Use `--env-file .env` to pass sensitive keys securely.
 
## Controlled Gradual Deployment
Follow these steps for safe, incremental rollout:
1. **Local Smoke Test**: Run a single Docker container locally and verify key endpoints:
   - Streamlit UI: `http://localhost:8501/`
   - API: `http://localhost:8000/process/`
2. **Gradually Increase Load**: Use Locust (`locustfile.py`) to simulate user traffic:
   ```bash
   locust -f locustfile.py --host http://localhost:8000
   ```
   - Begin with `--users 1 --spawn-rate 1`, then step up in increments.
3. **Monitor & Validate**: Observe logs and `SymbolicState` in UI, ensuring stability and acceptable response times.
4. **Scale Out**: Deploy on orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) with health checks, auto-scaling, and safe rollbacks.

## Symbolic Resonance
Sonny maintains a dynamic **SymbolicState** representing key events and reasoning flows:
- **SymbolicState.update(event, data)** records backend events (e.g., path executions, task parameters).
- **SymbolicState.get_state()** provides a real-time snapshot for debugging and UI display.
The Streamlit frontend automatically displays this state, reflecting Sonny’s internal symbolic reasoning.

## UI Symbolic Resonance Display
Each UI path (Silver, Gold, Cinnabar, Combined) now presents the current `SymbolicState` as a JSON panel, providing seamless insight into Sonny’s internal reasoning and fostering transparency.

## Structured Validation & Cleansing
To ensure resilience against invalid inputs, Sonny uses **Pydantic** models across backend components:
- **Input validation**: All user-provided parameters (coordinates, text, prompts) are parsed and validated via Pydantic.
- **Error logging**: Validation errors are logged with clear messages before any action is taken.
- **Cleansing & recovery**: Invalid inputs are automatically rejected or sanitized, maintaining stable operation.
This robust validation pipeline runs at every stage: frontend → backend → LLM integrations.

## Deployment with Docker
Sonny can be containerized for secure deployment:
- **Dockerfile** built on Python 3.11-slim.
- **Dependencies** installed from `requirements.txt`, including Pydantic, FastAPI, and Uvicorn.
- **Ports**: Streamlit UI on `8501`, FastAPI API on `8000`.
- **Secure env**: Launch with `--env-file .env` to pass sensitive keys.

> _Sonny’s architecture stands as a foundational framework for future autonomous agents, reflecting a “beautiful violet sheen” of cohesive automation logic._

## Frontend Modularization
The Streamlit UI has been refactored into reusable components under `frontend/components/`:
- **home.py**: Home page UI (`home_page()`)
